## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Application design and development is continuous and progressive
- Start by building small and grow gradually
- Tools are there to help you
- Be a smart developer with a keen detail in perfection and discipline

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Learn about tailwind css
- Improve my vanilla javascript skills (Front-end)
- Improve my knowledge on the NPM development environment
- Improve my knowledge on react and reactjs development

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) - This helped me understand the workflow of html, css and vanilla javascript and how to put them up together in react to build something special
- [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - This is an amazing website provided me with this challenge a a stepwise guidance on how to complete the project
